/* branch name js-pseudo
notes
-cards and styling done through html and css for the most part
-will need to start by defining variables with query selectors 
-will need to isolate the data points we want from the API 
-create a function that 
    a) randomly pulls player data from API array
    b) displays on the page using a for loop
    c) will need variables that specifically signify the number value at any given index
-separate function for user choice- this will contain logic for keeping score, and if statements to make sure the correct value is being attributed during gameplay. make this an event listener function?
-at end of game, we will need some kind of button that leads to scoreboard page? do we want the user to input their name on this window, or the score window? to discuss

-if modal for instructions on navbar, the js will need to be on all three files for consistency
